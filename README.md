# Spatiotemporal Database

## Introduction
This repository contains resources and code for working with spatiotemporal databases, focusing on traffic prediction models.

## PG-STGNN Model
PG-STGNN (Physics-guided Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network) is designed to predict traffic patterns by leveraging the underlying physics of traffic flow and spatial-temporal dependencies.

### Key Features:
- **Graph Structured Data**: Utilizes a graph-based approach to model spatial relationships.
- **Temporal Dynamics**: Incorporates time series data to understand the evolution of traffic patterns.
- **Physics-guided Learning**: Integrates physical principles to enhance prediction accuracy and interpretability.

## Physics-Guided Framework
This framework incorporates physical laws governing traffic dynamics to improve the model's performance and generalization.

### Important Components:
- **Traffic Density Models**: Utilize models based on conservation laws of fluid dynamics.
- **Real-time Predictions**: Capable of making predictions in an online manner.

## Installation
