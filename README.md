# PG-STGNN Traffic Flow Prediction System

The PG-STGNN (Persistence Graph Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network) is designed to predict traffic flow using advanced graph neural network techniques. This implementation focuses on using spatial-temporal data from traffic models to generate accurate predictions. The core components of the system include:

## Key Features
- **Data Ingestion**: Ability to handle large-scale traffic data inputs.
- **Graph Construction**: Constructs spatial graphs to represent traffic flow.
- **Temporal Dynamics**: Incorporates temporal patterns to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Model Training**: Utilizes deep learning libraries for training the neural network.

## Implementation Details in `traffic_models.py`
- The `traffic_models.py` file contains the main logic for building and training the PG-STGNN model. It includes functions for data preprocessing, model architecture, and evaluation metrics to analyze performance.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nandhakumar17102004/Spatiotemporal_database.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and run the `traffic_models.py` script to start predictions.
3. Refer to the documentation for detailed instructions on parameter settings and model customization.

## Conclusion
The PG-STGNN system aims to provide robust traffic flow predictions, enhancing urban mobility solutions through sophisticated data analysis and machine learning techniques.
